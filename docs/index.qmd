title: "HydroCube Overview"
---

**HydroCube** is a near realtime OLAP server that allows you to ingest data from multiple sources and query it in a fast and memory-efficient way. It is designed to be easy to use, secure, and scalable. It is written in Rust and uses DuckDB for the query engine. It has a full UI built with FINOS Perspective.

Why HydroCube?
It's an analytics cube designed to be very light in every respect so we named it after the lightest element, Hydrogen. It's also a cube, so we named it HydroCube.

## Key Features

- **Continuous data ingest** From multiple formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON)
- **Fast and Memory-Efficient**: Uses DuckDB for the query engine
- **Full UI**: Uses FINOS Perspective for UI
- **Single Binary**: Runs from a single binary, no dependencies, just point it at your data and run!

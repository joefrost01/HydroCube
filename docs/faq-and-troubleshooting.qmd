# FAQ & Troubleshooting

This page addresses common questions, errors, and performance tips for HydroCube. If you don’t see your issue here, feel free to [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/joefrost01/HydroCube/issues).

---

## 1. Ingestion

### 1.1. My CSV Files Aren’t Being Loaded

**Possible Causes**:
- The file pattern doesn’t match. For instance, `pattern: "*.csv"` but your file is `data.CSV` (uppercase).
- The directory watcher isn’t triggered if the file has no changes. Try editing the file or create a new one.

**Solutions**:
- Double-check your `directory` path and `pattern`.
- Make sure you have write permissions on the directory.
- Check HydroCube’s logs (stdout) for any errors.

### 1.2. Kafka Consumer Isn’t Receiving Messages

**Possible Causes**:
- Wrong broker address or port.
- Topic name is incorrect.
- Firewall or Docker networking issues.

**Solutions**:
- Verify you can reach Kafka via `kafkacat` or a similar CLI tool.
- Check that your `group_id` and `topic` match the actual Kafka setup.
- Look at HydroCube’s logs for any “failed to connect” messages.

## 2. UI / WebSockets

### 2.1. UI Fails to Load

**Possible Causes**:
- HydroCube is running on HTTPS but you’re hitting an HTTP URL.
- A firewall or reverse proxy is blocking the port.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you visit the correct scheme (HTTPS vs. HTTP) and port.
- If using a proxy, confirm it’s forwarding requests properly.

### 2.2. Real-Time Updates Don’t Appear

**Possible Causes**:
- No aggregator or publisher defined for your dataset.
- No new rows are actually arriving in DuckDB.
- The user hasn’t toggled the subscription for that cube in the UI.

**Solutions**:
- Check you have a `publishers:` block referencing an `aggregate:`.
- In the UI, look for the “Subscribe” toggle.
- Inspect logs for aggregator or WebSocket errors.

## 3. Security & OAuth

### 3.1. Browser Warnings About SSL

If you used a **self-signed certificate**, most browsers will warn you. This is normal for local testing. For production, use a CA-signed cert from Let’s Encrypt or another authority.

### 3.2. OAuth Redirect Loops

**Possible Causes**:
- `redirect_url` in your config doesn’t match what the provider expects.
- The OAuth credentials are invalid or were revoked.

**Solutions**:
- Update your OAuth provider’s app settings to match HydroCube’s `redirect_url`.
- Double-check the `client_id` and `client_secret`.

## 4. Performance Tips

### 4.1. Large CSVs Take Too Long

- **Batch Inserts**: HydroCube already batches inserts, but if you’re updating massive CSV files, consider splitting them into smaller chunks or using Parquet for more efficient loading.
- **Memory**: Provide enough RAM for DuckDB to do vectorized processing.
- **SSD / Fast Storage**: If your data file is huge, an SSD helps speed ingest.

### 4.2. High-Frequency Kafka Streams

- **One Writer Limit**: DuckDB has a single-writer concurrency model, so extremely high message rates could form a backlog.
- **Partitioning or Sharding**: If ingestion becomes a bottleneck, consider splitting topics or running multiple HydroCube instances (though each would have its own embedded DB).

## 5. General Errors & Logs

### 5.1. Checking Logs

HydroCube logs to **stdout** by default. You’ll see informational messages about ingestion, aggregator runs, and publisher updates. For debugging, you may want to run with higher verbosity or pipe logs into a monitoring system.

### 5.2. Common Log Messages

- **“Ingested X rows from file ...”**: File watcher successfully loaded data.
- **“Kafka consumer error ...”**: A problem with broker connectivity or message parsing.
- **“Aggregator updated table ...”**: The aggregator just recalculated.
- **“WebSocket error ...”**: Potential network issues or unsubscribes.
